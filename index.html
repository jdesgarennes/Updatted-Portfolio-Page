            <p><img src='./Assets/images/headshot.jpg'alt="Picture of me"> My is John des Garennes, I am currently working as a network
                 Engineer, and Learning web development. I am motivated to learn, and work hard at expanding my skillset to include Web 
                 development, and backend API infrastructure along with the concept of “Infrastructure as Code” Mentality. I Currently 
                 see the need to organize, and expand the management and creation of IT infrastructure, such as Network, Virtual systems, 
                 Storage, and Cloud infrastructure via source-controlled code. My goal is to be able to not only organize all aspects of this, 
                but to make it controllable and organized, so that others do not need to be experts in every field, but will be able to make
                declarative change control of all aspects of the environment. 
            
            
                 Some of my other interests are Electronics, 3D printing and other DIY projects. I Primarily like to utilize my current and future
                 skills with my hobbies and DIY projects. I feel it adds a lot of diversity to how I go about solving problems, and challenges at 
                 work and at home. I also take a great interest in science and the community at large. I currently live in Murrieta CA and work both 
                 at home and in the office for my employer. I work particularly well with groups and feel more productive when I am working with others.
